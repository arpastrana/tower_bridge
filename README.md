**Work in progress! Stay tuned for more details on this dataset.**

The tower and the bridge is a dataset of 3D bar structures in static equilibrium.
The structures in this repository are modeled as graphs. 
One graph encodes the topology, the geometry and the internal forces of a structure.

The goal of this dataset is to foster the development of new methods for structural design powered by graph-machine learning techniques.
We look forward to hearing how you use these graph-structured data in your research projects!
